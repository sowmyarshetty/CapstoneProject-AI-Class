### Executive Summary 

This project features a chatbot assistant built with Streamlit, designed to serve as a recommendation engine for home and kitchen products on Amazon. It uses content-based filtering, leveraging Amazon reviews to suggest products tailored to user preferences. The assistant addresses the challenge of browsing countless products and reviews by streamlining the decision-making process‚Äîsaving time and offering more relevant recommendations. The solution includes a Question-and-Answer model integrated with a large language model (LLM), enabling a conversational interface that enhances the shopping experience through intelligent, review-based suggestions.

* **Transformer Neural Network:** The foundational architecture used for natural language processing tasks.
* **Chatbot Assistant (Built with Streamlit):** A user-friendly interface that allows interactive conversations and product recommendations.
* **DistilBERT ‚Äì Question and Answering Model:** A lightweight transformer model used to extract relevant information from a subset of Amazon review data.
* **Large Language Model (LLM) ‚Äì Mistral with Prompt Engineering:** Processes raw Amazon review data using tailored prompts to generate accurate and context-aware responses.
* **Sentence-Transformer LML6 ‚Äì Semantic Similarity Model:** Computes sentence embeddings to identify and match semantically similar Amazon reviews for enhanced recommendation accuracy.

#### Chatbot Workflow & User Interaction

![Our_Strategy](images/flow_chart.png)

* **User Query**
  * User submits a natural language question via the chatbot interface.
* **Text Preprocessing & Embedding**
  * The query is cleaned, tokenized, and transformed into a dense vector using an embedding model.
  * Ensures compatibility with the vector-based retrieval system.
* **Vector Data Store**
  * Embedded query is compared against a database of pre-embedded Amazon reviews using FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search).
  * Enables fast and efficient similarity search.
* **Top Relevant Reviews**
  * The system retrieves the most semantically relevant reviews related to the user query.
* **Dual Pathway Analysis**
  * Left Path: Sentence Transformer (FAISS) - Uses a Sentence-Transformer model to interpret and extract the best-matching answers from the retrieved reviews.
* **Right Path: Mistral 8x7B (RAG/FAISS)**
  * Applies a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach using Mistral 8x7B.
  * Integrates review context into generated responses for higher fluency and depth.
* **Answer Selection & Response Formatting**
  * Outputs from both models are evaluated and formatted into a coherent, context-aware response.
* **ZonBot Final Response**
  * The final answer is delivered to the user through the chatbot interface.

### Modeling Process

1. **Load the CSV data file** containing Amazon reviews.
2. **Load the API key** for accessing Hugging Face models.
3. **Convert all records in the DataFrame into documents** using the load_docs function.
4. **Define the path** for storing the vector database.
5. **Store the document vectors incrementally** using the *store_incrementally_in_fiass* function.
6. **Load the vector database and initialize the chat function** using the HuggingFaceEndpoint with the *mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1* model as the LLM.
7. **Create a question-answer retrieval chain** using the *langchain.chains* framework.
8. **Use DistilBERT** *(DistilBertForQuestionAnswering)* as the first model for extracting answers from the documents.
9. **Use Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1** as the second model for generating natural, context-aware responses.
10. **Evaluate model performance** using the *F1 score* (balancing precision and recall) and the *BLEU score* (assessing language generation quality).

### Modeling Optimization
The downward trend in the training loss indicates that the model is improving its ability to fit the training data ‚Äî it's making fewer mistakes.
![Training_Loss](images/MiniLM_training_loss.png)

The model is making smaller updates over time, which typically suggests it's converging ‚Äî it's gradually adjusting weights with less intensity. This is a good sign, especially early in training, as it reflects the model settling into a local or global minimum in the loss landscape.
![Grad_Norm](images/model_grad_norm.png)

The learning rate is steadily decreasing from about *2.95e-5* to around *2.73e-5* over the training steps. This is a classic learning rate decay schedule ‚Äî usually done to help the model stabilize and fine-tune during training. That dip in gradient norm near step 2000 coincides with a lower learning rate, which is expected ‚Äî as gradients shrink, updates are smaller.

### Running Instructions

Getting Started with ZonBot (Amazon's Chatbot):

1. Ensure that **Streamlit** is installed on your machine. You can install it using *pip install streamlit* if needed.
2. **Download the entire repository** to your local machine for full functionality.
3. The Resource files are ENORMOUS and do not fit on GitHub.  **Download the Resources directory**, and all of its contents, from our Google Drive. https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1lhJ_R6L_CBbmKEIo9yVNMFvvQNazSDSv
4. Make sure you **download Resource folder into the Project Repository** to insure that everything works properly. 
5. Launch the app by running the **app.py** file. This is the main user interface and connects with both *LLMmodel.py* and *miniLMsentencetransformer.py* in the background.
6. A **demonstration video** can be seen here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1lhJ_R6L_CBbmKEIo9yVNMFvvQNazSDSv
7. Please use your **HuggingfaceEndpoint APIKEY** for access
8. Please refer to the **requirements.txt** file for the list of required libraries.
